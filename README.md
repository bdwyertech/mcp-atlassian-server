# mcp-atlassian-server

This is a Golang port of [sooperset/mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian).

This has some specific hacks to place nice specifically with server versions, not cloud.

This is primarily to learn MCP and experiment within a Golang context and will not be actively maintained.
